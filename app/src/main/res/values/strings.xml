    <string name="what5">Proper hand washing means washing your hands for at least <b>20-30 seconds with soap and water.</b> The constant rubbing action helps soap break down the grease and dirt that carry most germs.</string>
    <string name="what6">The simplest thing you can do is to <b>stay at home</b> to avoid physical contact and only go outside when it is <b>truly necessary.</b></string>
    <string name="what7">When you\'re outside, wear a mask, avoid crowds, and maintain at least 1-meter away from others to prevent the spread.</string>
